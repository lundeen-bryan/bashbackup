### Color Check and Prompt Setup

1. **Check for `force_color_prompt`**:
   - The first `if` statement checks if the variable `force_color_prompt` is set and non-empty. This variable can be set by your earlier function to force color prompts.

2. **Check for Color Capability**:
   - The inner `if` statement checks if the `tput` command is available (`-x /usr/bin/tput`) and if it can set foreground colors (`tput setaf 1`). The `tput setaf 1` command sets the text color, and `>&/dev/null` redirects any output to `/dev/null` (effectively silencing it).
   - If these conditions are met, it sets `color_prompt=yes`. This means your terminal can support colored text according to Ecma-48 (ISO/IEC-6429) standards.

3. **Setting the Prompt (`PS1`)**:
   - The next `if` statement sets the value of `PS1` (the shell prompt variable) based on whether `color_prompt` is `yes`.
   - If `color_prompt` is `yes`, it sets a colored prompt. `\[\033[01;32m\]` and similar sequences are ANSI color codes that set the color of the subsequent text in the prompt.
   - If `color_prompt` is not `yes`, it sets a standard non-colored prompt.

4. **Prompt Structure**:
   - The prompt includes your username (`\u`), hostname (`\h`), and the current working directory (`\w`). It also shows the Debian chroot environment (`${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}`), if applicable.
   - Colored prompts use ANSI escape codes to set colors. For example, `\[\033[01;32m\]` sets the color to light green.

5. **Unsetting Variables**:
   - Finally, `unset color_prompt force_color_prompt` is used to clean up and remove these variables from the environment after they've been used. This is a good practice to avoid unexpected behavior in child processes or scripts that might inherit these variables.

### Usage

- Place this script in your `.bashrc` file.
- It will automatically check if your terminal supports color and set a colored prompt accordingly.
- When you open a new terminal or source your `.bashrc`, this script will run and set your prompt.

This script is a robust way to ensure that your bash prompt is visually informative and adapts to the capabilities of your terminal emulator, enhancing the usability and aesthetics of your command-line interface.
